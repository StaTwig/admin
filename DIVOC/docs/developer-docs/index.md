## Developer Documentation

### Getting Started

In this section, we'll walk you through how to run DIVOC project on a local machine.

1. Install Docker Compose. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

    #### Basic Docker Compose Commands    
    * <a name="docker-compose-up"></a> 
    Staring services [`docker-compose up`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/)

    * <a name="docker-compose-restart"></a> 
    Restarting services [`docker-compose restart`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/restart/)

    * <a name="docker-compose-ps"></a> 
    Checking Status of services [`docker-compose ps`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/ps/)

    * <a name="docker-compose-logs"></a> 
    Monitoring service logs [`docker-compose logs`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/logs/)

2. Clone DIVOC repository onto your local machine and navigate to `DIVOC` directory

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:egovernments/DIVOC.git && cd DIVOC
    ```

3. Start all services in detached mode
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
   * Verify the state of containers [`docker-compose ps`]. All containers should be up.
   * Some services might fail to start because the dependent service might not be ready yet. 
    Restarting the failed service [`docker-compose restart <service>`] should start it successfully in this case.
   * If there are multiple service failures then restart below services
     ```
     docker-compose restart certificate_processor certificate_signer digilocker_support_api notification-service portal_api vaccination_api registry
     ```
   * If going to `localhost` returns status 502, restart nginx. `docker-compose restart nginx` 
   * On Mac/Windows services might crash with exit code : 137, if sufficient memory is not set for docker.
    This can be changed in Docker desktop preferences, resources tab as shown [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources).


4. Explore DIVOC
    
    Below are routes to access local apps. Remaining routes can be found in `nginx/nginx.conf`

    | Address | Application |
    |---------|-------------|
    | localhost | public app |
    | localhost/portal | portal app |
    | localhost/facility_app | facility app |
    | localhost/auth | keycloak |
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    #### DIVOC Walkthrough

    In this section we will go through the steps involved in a typical flow. Starting from
    setting up facilities to generating a certificate after vaccination. 
      
   * Set up Keycloack
      * Login to Keycloak console (`localhost/auth/admin`) as `admin` (password : `admin`)
      * Hover on `Master` on the left top corner and click on `Add realm`
      * Click on `Select File` button (import option)
      * Select `realm-export.json` in the keycloak directory. `path:DIVOC/keycloak`
      * Click on create.
   * Set up CLIENT_SECRET for `admin-api`
      * Login to Keycloak console (`localhost/auth/admin`) as `admin` (password : `admin`)
      * Click on `Clients` in Configure section on the left pane and click on `admin-api`
      * Go to Credentials tab, click on `Regenerate Secret` and copy the new secret
      * Change the `ADMIN_API_CLIENT_SECRET` to the copied secret in `docker-compose.yml`
      * Rebuild and restart the services that use `ADMIN_API_CLIENT_SECRET`.
        ```
         docker-compose up -d --build --no-deps <service1> <service2>...
         docker-compose restart nginx
        ```
        
   * Flagr Configuration
     * Below steps configure notification templates for the App. This can skipped if you don't want to test notifications.
     * Visit `localhost/config`. Enter `notification_templates`in the flag description field and click on `Create New Flag`
     * Click on the new flag created to configure it
        * In Flag section, change Flag key to `notification_templates`
